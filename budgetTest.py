import budget

# Call your methods here with test values to see if they work the way you expect them to.
# Remember that since your methods will be RETURNING information, it will only be visible if you PRINT that return value out to the console.
# Also, because the methods are in a different file, you must access them using dot syntax like "budget.simple_budget_checker()" to let the
#     computer know where to find their definitions.
# Your first test might look like this:

print(budget.simple_budget_checker(120))
